# Disjoint Set (union-find data structure)
seires of sets which are disjoint fron one another(不相交)
but every single element within a set is considered to be equivalent within that set(同样的identity)

{2, 5, 9}    identity element: 2
{0, 1, 4, 8} identity element: 0
{7}
{3, 6}

1. find(4) == find(8), return the same set identity 0
2. union (find(2), find(7))

# ADT
a collection of sets S = {s0, s1, ..., sk}
each set has a representative member
API: 
void makeSet (const T & t);
void set_union (const T & k1, const T & k2);
T & find(const T &k)
