# Prevent worst case
find running time: O(height)
single linked list

ideal: every element is pointing to identity element (flat)

# Smart Union 
## union by height
root: -height-1
(if an key has no parent: value = -1)

union: put the short tree -> high tree
no height added

## union by size
increase the height of less nodes

## Runtime
either way: O(lg(n))

# Path Compression on find
update
once we use a find, we update all nodes along the path pointing to the root directly!
all the rest nodes in the "subtree" are all closer to the root
