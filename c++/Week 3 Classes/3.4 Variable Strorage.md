# Access of instance stored in memory
1. Direct storage
2. By pointer
3. By reference

# Direct Storage
Type of a variable has no modifiers

# By pointer *
type of a variable modifired with an *
int *i // Pointer to an interger in the memory

# By reference &
an alias to existing memory and is denoted in the type with an ampersane (&)
does not store memory, only an alias

Cube &c = cube;

change c or cube are the same thing

never return a reference to a stack variable created on the stack of your current function
