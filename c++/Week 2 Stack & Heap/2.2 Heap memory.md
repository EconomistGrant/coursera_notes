# Memory existing longer than the lifecycle of the function
## starts from *low* addresses and grows up

## new operator
new operator returns a pointer to the momery
1. Allocate momery on the heap for the data structure
2. Initialize the data structure
3. Return a pinter

## int *numPtr = new int;
numPtr is a interger pointer on the stack;
that equals to the address of an interger on the heap

### cpp-heapMemory/main.cpp

### cpp-heapMemory/heap1.cpp
int main(){
    int *p = new int;
    Cube *c = new Cube;

    *p = 42;
    (*c).setLength(4);

    delete c;
    delete p;
    return 0;
}

## nullptr
pointer that point to somewhere we won't use: dangerous
address 0x0, never used, always generate "segmemtation fault" when accessed

so you should:
delete c;
c = nullptr;
detele p;
p = nullptr;

## ->
regarding:
(*c).setLength(4);
is identical to:
c -> setLength(4);

dereference c directly
remember c is an address!
### cpp-heapMemory/heap2.cpp
int main(){
    Cube *c1 = new Cube; // c1 is a cube pointer
    Cube *c2 = c1; // c2 points to the same place as c1

    c2 -> setLength(10);

    delete c2;
    delete c1; // !!

    return 0;
}
