Control over memory and lifecycle of every variable

# Stack
name, type, value, memory address
int primeNumber = 7

## & operator
return the memory address
### cpp-memory/addressOf.cpp

stack memory: associated with the *current* function and the momory's lifecycle is tied to the function
when the function return/ends, memory will be realased

## starts from *high* addresses and grows down
### cpp-memory/foo.cpp

# Pointer
a variable that stores the memory address of the data

## int *p = &num;
## *: dereference operator

p is a pointer;
*p is the value the the pointer is pointing to

int num = 7;
int *p = &num; // read it as "interger pointer p equals to the address of num"
int value_in_num = *p; // dereference
*p = 42; 
### cpp-momery/puzzle.cpp
memory will be realeased once the function CreateUnitCube() returns

### cpp-memory/main.cpp
*p changes: num will also change
