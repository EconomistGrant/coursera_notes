# Queue
first-in first out data structure, "queue"

# ADT
abstract data type:
how can this structure be used with data
how data interacts with the structure

# Queue ADT
1. Create
2. Push (add to the back)
3. Pop (remove from the front)
4. Empty (return true if the queue is empty)

# queue/main.cpp

# Implementation
array-based: keep track of inserting index, push at the end of the capacity

list-based: 
1. tail pointer to maintain
2. doubly-linked, back pointers
3. push at the front of the capacity

all four functions in both array and linked list will have O(1)
no matter how large the queue is!
