# Arrays:
width * index difference, multiplication
1 operation O(1)
# Linked list
x operation, x = index, O(n)

# Array Resize Strategy
## Strategy 1
when the array is full, add two to the capacity
total copies required to 2r: r^2 + r = O(n^2)

## Strategy 2
when the array is full, double the capacity
total copies required to n:
r = lg(n) 2(2^r -1) = O(n)

average work per element: O(n) / n = O(1)
amortized running time

O(1): constant time
O(n): linear time
O(n^2): polynomial
