Adjacency List  
insertVertex  -> O(1)*
removeVertex  -> O(deg(v))                    YES!
areAdjacent   -> O(min(deg(v1),deg(v2)))      WOESE THAN ADJANCY MATRIX BUT STILL GOOD 
incidentEdges -> O(deg(v))                    YES!
space: n + m

Edge list implementation
insertVertex  -> O(1)*
removeVertex  -> O(m)    //O(1) by hashing, but O(m) to remove edges
areAdjacent   -> O(m)
incidentEdges -> O(m)
space: n + m

Adjacency Matrix
insertVertex  -> O(n)    //new row/column     NO!
removeVertex  -> O(n)
areAdjacent   -> O(1)                         YES!
incidentEdges -> O(n)
space: n * n


areadjacent: choose matrix
