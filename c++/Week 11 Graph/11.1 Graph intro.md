# Intro
conflict-free final exam scheduling graph
edge: at least one student taking both courses
same shape: can have exams at the same time
graph coloring problem!

# Vocabulary
G = (V, E)    Graph, Vertices(nodes), Edges
Subgraphs, disconnected, G1, G2, G3
|V| = n
|E| = m

incident edge
degree: number of incident edges a node has
adjacent vertices (of a vertex): all the verties connected to a certain node, A(v0)
Path(G2): sequence of vercies
Cycle(G1): common begin and end
Simple Graph(G): no self-loops/multi-edges

# Edges 
minimum edges:
not connected: 0
connected: n - 1

maximum edges:
simple: n(n-1)/2
not simple: infinite

the sum of all degrees = 2m
