# buildHeap
1. sorted array, and its a heap (like building a sorted array)
2. call insert every time (like building a BST)
3. dont consider any leaves
   only consider the fisrt half, heapifydown (N/2 operations)
   O(n)

# Runtime analysis
heap sort -> sorted array
1. build a heap O(n)
2. n * removeMin O(lg(n)) = nlg(n)
3. Swap

1. nlg(n)
2. in-memory sort!
