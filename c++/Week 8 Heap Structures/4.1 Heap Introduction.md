# Purpose
remove the minimum value efficiently without sorting
remove() has no argument, remove the minumum

# Priority Queue

# (min) Heap
binary tree is min-heap if:
1. T = {}
2. T = {r, TL,TR}, where r is less than the roots of {TL, TR} and {TL, TR} are min-heaps

descendants must be larger than the node itself

# complete tree
we can represent complete tree as an array
(perfect tree is perfect up until the last level and all leaf nodes on the last level)

if we know the node
its parent: [i/2] (i starts at 1!)
its childres: 2i(L), 2i+1(R)
