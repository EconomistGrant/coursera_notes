# Build through insert
1. check capacity and grow array (if a doubling principle, every double will create exact space for a level)
2. put at back
3. check that its parent is smaller
4. if not: swap it with parent (R< Parent, Parent < L, R will be a good parent to L and P)
   _heapifyup, recursively (on its index of parent)

# Removemin
Removemin means removing the root
1. replace root with the last element
2. heapifydown, swap the smallest child with the parent (if parent is not the smallest), recursively
