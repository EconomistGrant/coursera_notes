# Tree
A linked structure with a sense of ancestry (parents, children, sibings, ...)

root, sub-branches

# node
element
## single root node: no incoming edges
## leaf node: no outgoing edges

## nodes will store data and may be labled

# edge
connection between two nodes
## edges do not have names but are reffred by nodes they connect

# Parent
Each node has exactly one parent node
children
- 0 to infinite number of children
sibling: nodes that share a parent

# To be a tree
1. a root
2. directed edges
3. no cycle

tree is a "rooted, directed, and acyclic" structure
