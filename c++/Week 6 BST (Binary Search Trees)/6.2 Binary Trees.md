# Binary tree
every node has at most two children
lable "left child" and "right child"

# binary-tree/BinaryTree.h
// two Node pointer for each node compared with linked list
template <typename T>
class BinaryTree{
    public:
    // ...

    private:
        class TreeNode {
            public:
            T & data;
            TreeNode *left, *right;
            TreeNode(T & data) :
                data(data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr){ }
        };
    
    TreeNode *root_;
}

# Height
number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf

# Full Tree
every node has either zero or two children

# Perfect Tree
all the interior nodes have two children and leaves are at the same "level"

# Complete Tree
perfect tree is perfect up until the last level and all leaf nodes on the last level
are pushed to the left

full tree can be incomplete
complete tree can be unfull...
