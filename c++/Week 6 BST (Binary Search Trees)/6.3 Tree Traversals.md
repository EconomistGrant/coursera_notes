# How to get data out of the tree/how to traverse tree?
shout(print)-left-right (pre-order traversal)
visit every node in the tree exactly once

# in-order tree traversal
left-shout-right
the exact equation

go deep left until can't - shout - right
entire left - root shout - entire right

# post-order tree traversal
left-right-shout
root will be shout the last

# level-order traversal
first level shout
second level shout
