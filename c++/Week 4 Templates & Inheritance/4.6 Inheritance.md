# Inheritance
allows for a class to inherit all member functions and data from a base class into a derived class

Shape -> Cube


# cpp-inheritance/Shape.h
#pragma once

class Shape {
  public:
    Shape();
    Shape(double width);
    double getWidth() const;

  private:
    double width_;
};


# cpp-inheritance/Cube.h
#Pragma once

#include "Shape.h"
#include "HSLAPixel.h"

namespace uiuc {
    class Cube : public Shape{
        public:
            Cube(double width, uiuc::HSLAPixel color);
            double getVolume() const;
        private:
             uiuc::HSLAPixel color_; 
    }
}

# Initialization list
When a derived class initialized: must construct the base class
- default constructor

## cpp-inheritance/Cube.cpp

double Cube::getVolume() const {

    // can not access private member directly, but through public function of base class
}
