# B-tree intro
disks seek
having a node that contains a number of keys
each key has a pointer to another tree node inside of it

BTree of order 9 (max number of keys + 1):
-3 9 23 24 31 42 43 55

minimizes the number of operations to get the data

# Btree of order m
1. all keys within a node are in sorted order
2. each node contains no more than m-1 keys
3. each internal node can have at most m children
   root: [2, m] children
   internal node (non-root, non-leaf): [m/2, m] (at least half full)
4. All leaves are on the same level
"m-way" tree

## eg: 
plug in 14 19 47 42 81 into a tree of order 5
1. 14 19 47 82
2. the middle will be "throw up"
   42
14|19  47|81

"after searching for the leaf node where the new key should go, the lead is split in half as two separate leaf nodes, 
and then the middle value is thrown up to the layer above as an inserted key,
and this insertion and rebalancing repeats until a new root key rises to the top,
which adds a layer to the tree"
