# Balanced BSTs
every node's balance factor has a magnitude of 0 or 1

# Sub-structures
Mountain: one node that has two children
Stick: one node has a only child which has a only child (two same direction)
Elbow: one node has a only child which has a only child (two different direction)

# Stick -> Mountain
Deepest node in the tree that is out of balance
1. find the stick causing the problem
2. raising the middle one up as a mountain
(Generic left rotation)

# Elbow -> Stick
unbend, put the last one to the middle
(left-right rotation)
