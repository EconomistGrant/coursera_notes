# Dijkstra's Algorithm
minHeap to store vertex, labled set, ..
each update, the adjacent nodes of the incoming node, will have the value of the distance of this node to starting point (or the value of incoming node + edge)

update rule: if the path is shorter

pseudocode:
```python
if cost(u, v) + d[u] < d[v]:
    d[v] = cost(u, v) + d[u] 
    p[v] = m
```

"SSSP" single source shortest path
single source: node A

# Edge cases
1. single heavy-weight path vs. multiple light-weight path
    successful
2. negative cost edge weight?
   negative weight cycle < 0, mathematically : no shortest path
   but actually any negative weights -> Dijkstra won't work
3. undirected graph
    successful

# Runtime
Fibonacci heap
O(m + nlg(n))
