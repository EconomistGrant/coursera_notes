# Traversal
visit every vertex and every edge in the graph
search for intersting sub-structures

tree: ordered, obvious start, completion is clear
graph: unordered, no start, no clear completion

maintain "things visited"

# BFS (Breadth-First Search)
A   B C D
B   A C E
C   A B D E F
D   A C F H
E   B C E
...
(already maintained in the data)

A 
remove A,                      mark as visited
add B C D to the queue
remove B                       mark as visited
add (A) (C) E to thr queue
remove C                       mark as visited
...

discovery edge: find edge by finding a new node
cross edge: find edge when finding a visited node

# BFS analysis 
count component by the number of times calling BFS
cycle: cross edge = cycle
## running time
n + 2m (or n ^ 2)

shortest path: 
if starting vertex: follow discovery edge
if not: not possible

following a cross edge: never get more than one step further/nearer than the start

structure by starting point and series of discovery edges:
spanning tree: span the entire graph

# DFS (Depth-First Traversal)
stack instead of queue
back edge: like a discovery edge in BFS

labeling: 
vertex -> O(n)
Edge   -> O(m)
queries:
vertex -> O(n)
Edge   -> O(m)
total: O(n+m)

no way faster! optimal!
