# Landmark Path Problem
all edges have cost of 3, find the shortest number of edges
just do BFS, discovery edges, cross edges,....

same edge length, but I want to go A -> L -> G
A -> L + L -> G?
what is the quickest algorithm?
which point should be started with?

running BFS once with start point L
a single traversal!
