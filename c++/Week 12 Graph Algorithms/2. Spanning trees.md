# Minimum Spanning Tree
minimal total number of edges/minimal weights
G: connected, undirected

G': a spanning graph of G, a tree with minimal total weight among all spanning trees

Kruskal's algorithm vs. Prim's algorithm

# Kruskal Algorithm
minHeap of edges:
maintain a minHeap of edges, from small weight to large

disjoint set of indices

check the top of minHeap: are the two in the same set?
if not: union together
...

check the edges used in union

the smallest spanning tree. YOU COULD NOT FIND A SMALLER ONE

## Runtime analysis
            Heap           Sorted Arrat
Building    O(m)             O(mlogm)
removeMin   O(log(m))        O(1)
Total       O(m + mlog(m))   O(mlogm + m)
            O(mlog(m))       O(mlogm)

(build disjoint set: n, however n < m)

# Prim's Algorithm
fact: to connect two subgraph: the smallest edge, will be a part of the minimum spanning

start with A:
- labled set: A
- unlabled set: all others

minimum edge break two subgraph (partition), joined new vertex, update partition

## Implementation
weight for vertices, maintain a heap
starting point: A -> 0 , B, C, D, ... -> inf

update priority queue with incident edge 
removeMin

check if the removed vertex, could affect the priority queue

Vertex m = Q.removeMin();
foreach (Vertex v : neigbots of m not in labled set)
if (cost(v, m) < d[v]){
    d[v] = cost(v,m);
    p[v] = m;

## runtime
                  Adj. matrix           Adj. list
Heap             O(n^2 + mlg(n))       O(nlg(n) + mlg(m))
Unsorted Array   O(n^2)                 O(n^2)

Sparse: m ~ n, ...   -> mlgm
Dense:  m ~ n^2, ..  -> n^2lg(n) (or mlgm?)
